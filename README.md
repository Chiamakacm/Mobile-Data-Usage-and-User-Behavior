# Why I chose this topic?
I have seen so many articles around mobile phone usage that I wanted to see if this is seen more amoung certain demographics. I wanted to answer the below questions;
  1. Does age impact your screen time?
  2. Is there a relationship between your gender or the operating system you use and screen time?
  3. What can increased screen time predict?

# Running the code
I used visual studio and installed Pythons version 3. The main libaries used are pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib and sklearn. 

# File
The notebook contains all the code and findings. The csv file shows the data set used

# Results
The findings and answers to the 3 main questions I was asking can be found in the link below
